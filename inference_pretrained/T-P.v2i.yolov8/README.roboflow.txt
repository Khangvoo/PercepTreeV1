The dataset includes 36801 images.
Tree-person-people-tree are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 30 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -5 and +5 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
